Imagine we have an AsyncExecutor class that performs some useful task asynchronously via the method execute().
In addition, the method accepts a function object that acts as a callback and gets invoked after the asynchronous execution is done.
The asynchronous work is simulated using sleep. A passed-in call is invoked to let the invoker take any desired action after the asynchronous processing is complete.
Your task is to make the execution synchronous without changing the original classes
